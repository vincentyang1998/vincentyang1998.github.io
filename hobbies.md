## Volleyball

<br>Nothin' beats the thrill of setting up a full-on volleyball showdown every weekend! Summer turned into my volleyball season, and it's become a routine that I look forward to every week. In those lively afternoons, we come together, rallying, and cheering each other on. Surprisingly, many folks are new to the game, but I'm lucky to be part of a crew of super enthusiastic partnersâ€”always open to welcoming newcomers with open arms. Ready for more serves, spikes, and good times ahead! 



## Music

<br>My musical tastes? Let's just say they're as diverse as a Spotify shuffle. Catch me at a K-pop concert, soaking in the beats. Find me at a classical music performance, lost in the timeless melodies. Or maybe spot me at a Broadway musical, where every note tells a story. From K-pop vibes to classical tunes to Broadway beats, I'm all in for the musical smorgasbord. 

## Literature and Art

In the tapestry of everyone's life, there are two concentric circles. The outermost layer woven with work, status, and wealth, while the innermost holds the ineffable secrets, unattainable dreams, and ambitions that linger in the shadows. For me, literature and art serve as rare portals, gently unlocking the hidden corners of my heart. 

## My Cat

My love, Mona, is a blue british shorthair.
