What fascinates me about accounting is that it puts the classic question of how people use limited information and resources to think about problems and make decisions from an academic level into the real world. Information asymmetry underpins the existence of transactions, necessitating individuals to draw inferences with limited resources and information in the quest for optimal decisions. This dynamic extends to the functioning of capital markets, where a significant portion of information is conveyed through financial data and accounting statements.
