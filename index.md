Here is **Vincent Yang (田珩)**.

I am a finance master's student at the University of Rochester, where I also serve as a Financial Statement Analysis tutor. Prior to my graduate studies, I held the role of Financial Due Diligence Analyst at a consulting firm, engaging in projects ranging from short-selling investigations to PE buy-side due diligences. In addition, I gained practical experience through internships in FP&A roles at GE, Bosch, and Vanke.
